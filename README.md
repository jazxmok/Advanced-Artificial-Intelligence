🤖 Advanced Artificial Intelligence Portfolio
Welcome to my Advanced Artificial Intelligence portfolio – a curated collection of projects, research, and experiments exploring the frontiers of modern AI. This repository features hands-on implementations of deep learning, generative models, reinforcement learning, and more.

🧠 “AI is not just about making machines think — it’s about expanding the limits of human imagination through machines.”

🚀 What You'll Find Here
This repository showcases a range of advanced AI techniques and practical implementations, including but not limited to:

🧬 Neural Networks – CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and attention mechanisms.

♻️ Reinforcement Learning – Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Unity ML-Agents.

🎨 Generative AI – GANs, VAEs, and image synthesis.

🗣️ NLP with Transformers – Text summarization, sentiment analysis, fine-tuning BERT/GPT models.

🔍 Explainable AI – SHAP, LIME, and model fairness techniques.

🛠️ Deployment & MLOps – Model packaging, APIs, and cloud-based inference (AWS, GCP).
